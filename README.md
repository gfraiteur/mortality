This repo provides an analysis of the excess mortality in 2020 in Belgium. It contains the source code of both the scripts and the
article, but not the data itself.

* To read the article, go to the [rendered article](rendered/Belgium_en.md).
* To edit the article, open [Belgium_en.Rmd](Belgium_en.Rmd).
* The script that downloads the data and processes tham is [Belgium.R](Belgium.R). Note that you will need to
 create an account with the website https://www.mortality.org and download the file https://www.mortality.org/hmd/BEL/STATS/Mx_1x1.txt
 manually.
 
This article and the scripts are open sources and the data sources are public. If you found errors, please
